We study the problem of synthesizing a controller for a robot with a \emph{surveillance objective}, that is, the robot is required to  maintain knowledge of the location of a moving, possibly adversarial target. We formulate this problem as a one-sided partial-information  game in which the winning condition for the agent is specified as a temporal logic formula. The specification formalizes the surveillance requirement given by the user, including additional non-surveillance tasks. In order to synthesize a surveillance strategy that meets the specification, we transform the partial-information game into a perfect-information one, using abstraction to mitigate the exponential blow-up typically incurred by such transformations. This transformation enables the use of off-the-shelf tools for reactive synthesis. We use counterexample-guided refinement to automatically achieve abstraction precision that is sufficient to synthesize a surveillance strategy. We evaluate the proposed method on two case-studies, demonstrating its applicability to large state-spaces and diverse requirements.\looseness=-1

We study the problem of synthesizing a controller for a robot with a \emph{surveillance objective}, that is, the robot is required to  maintain knowledge of the location of a moving, possibly adversarial target. We formulate this problem as a one-sided partial-information  game as the location of the target is not always known. We transform the partial-information game into a perfect-information one, using abstraction to mitigate the exponential blow-up typically incurred by such transformations. We then leverage this reduction by assigning \emph{surveillance predicates} to the belief states allowing us to specify the winning condition for the agent as a temporal logic formula. The specification formalizes the surveillance requirement given by the user, including additional non-surveillance tasks. This framework enables the use of off-the-shelf tools for reactive synthesis. We demonstrate the ability of this framework in experiments to tailor different surveillance behaviour characteristics based on the needs of the user.

%given a linear temporal logic specification, as well as a surveillance objective where it is required to maintain knowledge of the location of a moving, possibly adversarial target. We formulate this problem as a one-sided partial-information game. We then reduce the partial-information game to a full-observation game using an abstracted belief set construction to avoid the exponential blow up of the state space. In order to ensure the surveillance requirement is satisfied, we allow it to be encoded in three different ways : a safety objective, a liveness objective, or both depending on the qualitative behavioural requirement for the user. This requirement is then appended to the original specification and formulated as an assume-guarantee problem for reactive synthesis on the abstract belief-set game. We then use a counterexample-guided abstraction refinement scheme to refine the abstract belief states until a reactive controller can be synthesized.
