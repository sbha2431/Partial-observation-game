We report on the application of our method for surveillance synthesis to two case studies. We have implemented the simulation in \texttt{Python}, using the \texttt{slugs} reactive synthesis tool~\cite{EhlersR16}. The experiments were performed on an Intel i5-5300U 2.30 GHz CPU with 8 GB of RAM. 

\subsection{Liveness surveillance specification + task specification}
Figure~\ref{fig:case1} shows a gridworld divided into  'rooms'. The surveillance objective requires the agent to infinitely often know precisely the location of the target (either see it, or have a belief consisting of one cell). Additionally, it has to perform the task of patrolling (visiting infinitely often) the green 'goal' cell. Formally, the specification is $\LTLglobally\LTLfinally p_1 \wedge \LTLglobally\LTLfinally \mathit{goal}$. The agent can move between $1$ and $3$ grid cells at each step. The sensor mode, that is, the visibility function, used here is 'line-of-sight' with a range of 5 cells. The agent cannot see through obstacles (shown in red) and cannot see further than 5 cells.

Using the abstraction partition of size 7 shown in Figure \ref{fig:case1}, the overall number of states in the two-player game is $15\times10 + 2^7 = 278$ states. In contrast, solving the full abstract game will have in the order of $2^{150}$ states, which is a state-space size that state-of-the-art synthesis tools cannot handle.

Figure \ref{fig:case1exp} shows how the belief of the agent (shown in grey) can grow quickly when it cannot see the target. This growth occurs due to the coarseness of the abstraction, which overapproximates the target's true position. In 7 timesteps, the agent believes the target can be anywhere in the grid that is not in its vision. It has to then find the target in order to satisfy the surveillance requirement. In this example, an abstraction partition of size 7 was enough to guarantee the satisfaction surveillance specification.  For the purpose of comparison, we also solve the game with  an abstraction partition of size 12  to illustrate the change in belief growth. Figure \ref{fig:case1fineexp} shows the belief states growing much more slowly as the abstract belief states are smaller, and thus they approximates  more closely  the true belief of the agent.

%Starting with an abstract game with 104 states generated by a partition with four elements, our refinement algorithm terminates after 5 iterations (with total running time of 821 s). The resulting partition $\mathcal{Q} = \{Q_1,...,Q_9 \}$ has $9$ elements shown as the numbered regions in Figure~\ref{fig:case1}. Thus, the final refined abstract game has $616$ abstract states ($2^9$ abstract belief states). In contrast, the belief-set game structure would have in the order of $2^{100}$ states, which is a state-space size that state-of-the-art synthesis tools cannot handle.


%The refinement algorithm terminates after 5 iterations to produce the abstract partition  corresponding to the numbered sets in figure . There are 9 belief states which results in an additional $2^9 = 512$ states to the full observation game which is far lower than the full reduction which will be a power set of all 104 states.

The additional abstraction partitions result in a much larger game as the state space grows exponentially in the size of the abstraction partition. Table \ref{tab:exp1} compares the sizes of the corresponding abstract games, and the amount of time it takes to synthesize a surveillance controller for each of them.


\begin{table}[h!]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
	Size of abstraction partition & Size of abstract game & Synthesis time \\ \hline \hline
		7 & 278 & 37s \\ 
		12 & 4346 & 527s \\ 
	\end{tabular}\caption{Comparison of synthesis times for the two cases} \label{tab:exp1}
\end{table}


A video simulation can be found at \url{http://goo.gl/YkFuxr}. This illustrates the searching behaviour of the agent when it is trying to lower the belief below the threshold in order to satisfy the liveness specification. Note the behaviour of the agent will contrast with the behaviour under safety surveillance which will we look at next.

\subsection{Safety surveillance specification + task specification}
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{case2.png}\caption{Gridworld representing an outdoor environment.}\label{fig:case2}
\vspace{-.5cm}
\end{figure}
Figure~\ref{fig:case2} depicts a gridworld of an 'outdoor' environment where the red blocks model buildings. 
In this setting, we enforce the safety surveillance objective $\square p_{30}$ (the belief size should never exceed 30) in addition to infinitely often reaching the green cell. The formal specification is $\LTLglobally\LTLfinally p_{30} \wedge \LTLglobally\LTLfinally \mathit{goal}$. Additionally, the target itself is trying to reach the goal cell infinitely often as well, which is known to the agent.

We used an abstraction generated by a partition of size 6, which was sufficiently precise to compute a surveillance strategy in 210 s. Again, note that the precise belief-set game would have in the order of $2^{200}$ states.
 
We simulated the environment and the synthesized surveillance strategy for the agent in ROS. A video of the simulation can be found at \url{http://goo.gl/LyC1gQ}. Note the qualitative difference in behaviour compared to the previous example. There, in the case of liveness surveillance, the agent had more leeway to completely lose the target in order to reach its goal location, even though the requirement of reducing the size of the belief to $1$ is quite strict. Here, on the other hand, the safety surveillance objective, even with a large threshold of $30$, forces the agent to follow the target more closely, in order to prevent its belief from getting too large. The synthesis algorithm thus provides the ability to obtain qualitatively different behaviour as necessary for specific applications by combining different objectives.

\subsection{Discussion of behaviour}
The difference in the behaviour in the case studies highlights the different use cases of the surveillance objectives. Depending on the domain, the user can specify a combination of safety and liveness specification to tune the behaviour of the agent. In a critical surveillance situation (typical in defense or security situations), the safety specification will guarantee to the user that the belief will never grow too large. However, in less critical situations (such as luggage carrying robots in airports), the robot has more flexibility in allowing the belief to grow as long as it can guarantee its reduction in the future.
