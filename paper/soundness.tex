\begin{theorem}
Let $G$ be a surveillance game structure, $\part = \{Q_i\}_{i=1}^n$ be a partition and $G_\abstr = \alpha_\part(G)$ be the corresponding abstract game structure. For every surveillance objective $\varphi$, if there exists a wining strategy for the agent in the abstract game $(\alpha_\part(G),\varphi)$, then there exists a winning strategy for the agent in the surveillance game $(G,\varphi)$.
\end{theorem}
