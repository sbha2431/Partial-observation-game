For a partitioning $\part = \{Q_i\}_{i=1}^n$ of the set of states $\states$ in a game structure $G$ we define the function $\alpha_\part : \states \to \part$ such that for $s \in\states$ we let $\alpha_\part(s) = Q$ where $Q \in \part$ and $s \in Q$.
By abuse of notation we denote also with $\alpha_{\part} : \mathcal{P}(\states) \to \mathcal{P}(\part)$ the function defined by $\alpha_{\part}(S') = \{\alpha_\part(s) \mid s \in S'\}$.

Given a partitioning $\part = \{Q_i\}_{i=1}^n$ we define the game structure 
$G_\abstr  = (\states_\abstr,s^\init_\abstr,T_\abstr)$, where
\begin{itemize}
\item $\states_\abstr = L_a \times \mathcal P(\part) \cup L_a \times \big\{\{\{l_t\}\big\} \mid l_t \in L_t\}$ is the set of states with $L_a$ the locations of the agent and $\mathcal P(\part)$ the set of abstract states approximating belief sets
\item $s^\init_\abstr = (l_a^\init,\alpha_Q(\{l_t^\init\}))$ is the initial state,
\item $\trans_\abstr \subseteq \states_\abstr \times \states_\abstr$ is the transition relation such that $((l_a, A_t),(l_a', A_t')) \in T_\abstr$ if and only if some of the following four conditions is satisfied
\begin{itemize}

\item $A_t' = \{\{l_t'\}\}$ for $l_t' \in L_t$ with $\vis(l_a',l_t') = \true$, and 
$A_t = \{\{l_t\}\}$ and $((l_a,l_t),(l_a',l_t')) \in T$;
\item $A_t' = \{\{l_t'\}\}$ for $l_t' \in L_t$ with $\vis(l_a',l_t') = \true$, and
$A_t = \{B_1,\ldots,B_m\}$ with $m > 1$, and for some $B_i \in A_t$ and $l_t \in B_i$ we have $\vis(l_a,l_t) = \false$ and $((l_a,l_t),(l_a',l_t')) \in T$;


\item $A_t = \{\{l_t\}\}$ and $A_t' = \alpha_\part(B')$ where

$\begin{array}{lll}
B' = \{l_t' & \mid & \vis(l_a',l_t') = \false \text{ and }\\
&& ((l_a,l_t),(l_a',l_t')) \in T\}
\end{array}
$

\item $A_t = \{B_1,\ldots,B_m\}$ for some $m > 1$, and\\ $A_t' = \alpha_\part(B')$ where

$\begin{array}{lll}
B' = \{l_t' & \mid & \vis(l_a',l_t') = \false \text{ and }\\
&&\exists B \in A_t \exists l_t \in B.\; \vis(l_a,l_t) = \false \text{ and }\\
&&\phantom{\exists B \in A_t \exists l_t \in B.\;} ((l_a,l_t),(l_a',l_t')) \in T
\}
\end{array}
$
\end{itemize}
The first two conditions capture the successor locations of the target that can be observed from the agent's successor location, while the last two conditions  correspond to the belief set that consists of all possible successor locations of the target that are not visible from the corresponding successor location of the agent. Unlike in the definition of the belief-set game, here we distinguish different cases also with respect to the current state. In particular, in case the abstracted belief set is not a singleton set we take into account only the successors of transitions emanating from concrete states where the target location is not visible.

\end{itemize}

\Rayna{As in the definition of $T_\belief$ we also have the problem that $A_t'$ depends on $l_a'$ and not only on $(l_a,A_t)$.}
