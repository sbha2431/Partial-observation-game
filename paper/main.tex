\begin{abstract}
We study the problem of synthesizing a controller for a robot given an Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) specification, as well as a surveillance objective where it is required to maintain knowledge of the location of a moving adversarial target. We formulate this problem as a one-sided partial information game. We then reduce the partial information game to a full observation game using an abstracted belief set construction to avoid the exponential blow up of the state space. In order to ensure the surveillance requirement is satisfied, we allow it to be encoded in three different ways - a safety objective, a liveness objective, or both depending on the qualitative behavioural requirement for the user. This is then appended to the original specification and formulated as an assume guarantee problem for reactive synthesis on the abstract belief-set game. We then use a counterexample guided abstraction refinement scheme to refine the abstract belief states until a reactive synthesis controller is found.
