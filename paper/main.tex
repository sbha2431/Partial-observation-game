\begin{abstract}
We study the problem of synthesizing a controller for a robot given a linear temporal logic specification, as well as a surveillance objective where it is required to maintain knowledge of the location of a moving, possibly adversarial target. We formulate this problem as a one-sided partial-information game. We then reduce the partial-information game to a full-observation game using an abstracted belief set construction to avoid the exponential blow up of the state space. In order to ensure the surveillance requirement is satisfied, we allow it to be encoded in three different ways : a safety objective, a liveness objective, or both depending on the qualitative behavioural requirement for the user. This requirement is then appended to the original specification and formulated as an assume-guarantee problem for reactive synthesis on the abstract belief-set game. We then use a counterexample-guided abstraction refinement scheme to refine the abstract belief states until a reactive controller can be synthesized.
