\subsubsection{Counterexamples for safety surveillance objectives}
A \emph{counterexample strategy} for the environment in the surveillance game $\Surveillance(G_\abstr,k)$ is a finite tree whose nodes are labelled with states in $\states_\abstr$ and which is such that
\begin{itemize}
\item the root of the tree is labelled with $s_\abstr^\init$
\item each leaf of the tree is labelled with a state $s_\abstr$ such that  $|\gamma(s_\abstr)|  > k$;
\item for each non-leaf node labelled with a state $s_\abstr$ we have $|\gamma(s_\abstr)|  \leq k$
\item the tree branches according to all possible of the agent.
\end{itemize}

A \emph{path} in $G_\abstr$ is a sequence of states $s_0,\ldots,s_n$ such that $s_0 = s_\abstr^\init$ and $(s_i,s_{i+i}) \in T_\abstr$ for each $i < n$.
